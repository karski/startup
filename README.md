# Feedback Map:

Started March 2019.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

At the moment because I don't have an 'create area' form I have to manually add it to `DynamoDB` in the GraphQL editor, then copy the `ID` into `src/constants/index.js` as `tempAreaId`.

Only then can I signup as that is needed in the user creation.

Also, after replaceing the whole 'amplify api' delete the user pool for a fresh start.
